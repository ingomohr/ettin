# Ettin

Ettin - tExT exTractIoN tool - is a tool to parse documents into trees.

## Goals
This repo aims to provide a lightweight scanner and parser API that

- can be used out of a box and doesn't necessarily require generating a parser
- provides a tree that can be used and edited by later on
- doesn't require an Eclipse environment (but can be used in such)
- is based on Java17
- provides Java modules

## Motivation
In 2007 I wrote a tool of same name (for preparation for my "Compiler Construction" exam and also because we needed a DSL in one of our inhouse tools back then). So, this repo also is a nostalgic dive in a way.

Back in the day I used this book:

**Compilers**<br/>
Principles, Techniques, & Tools<br/>
Second Edition<br/>
Aho,Lam,Sethi,Ullman<br/>
2007<br/>
ISBN-13: 978-0-321-49169-5<br/>
